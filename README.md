The assignment for this week was to create a password generator in Javascript.

At first I was stuck because I wasn't sure where to start. Then I spoke with my tutor who helped me think through the problem with psuedocode before attempting to write any code.

This step was very helpful! Originally I was overwhelemed by the sheer number of different ways to organize the concept.

The assignment requires that we ask the user what kind of characters they would like to use in their passwords and then generate a random string of characters to suit their choice.

The first step was to create variables for the different kinds of characters that are available, so one var for lower case, one for upper case, another for special characters and a 4th var for numbers.

I then created variable for all of the options that I wanted the user to have, as well as a variable for the password itself, and a variable for the length of the final password.
